V1.0
Dark Crystal - Gelfling
Basic mod for what will hopefully become a series of mods tributing Jim Henson's The Dark
Crystal. So far it only contains a general race that is the Gelfling, but there are plans
for much more.

Requires: erdelf Humanoid Alien Races 2.0 mod

Suggested: EdB Prepare Carefully mod

Known Problems:
- Portrait image has misaligned ears
- Male Gelfling can be assigned with the Maudra/All Maudra backstory
- Can be more than 1 All Maudra
- "Skiing on weapons" (see pictures)

Future Plans:
- Animals: Landstriders, Nebries, Garthim, Arathim, Fizgig, Hollerbats, Muski
- Races: Gelfling clans, Skeksis, urRu (Mystics), Gruenak, Aughra, Podling, Lore
- Items: Healing plants, insect meals, Gelfling essence, Crystal Shard, Firca, Bola
- Events: restore the Crystal of Thra, Great Conjuncture, feast, Tithing
- Biomes: Spriton Plains, Dark Wood, Highlands?, Crystal Sea, Black River, Caves of Grot
- Misc: give girls wings, add Vliyaya (from J.M. Lee's books), better art, standard scenario

This is my first mod and I do not know what I am doing most of the time, but it has been fun
so far. I would love to hear feedback on what is already here and maybe suggestions on
how to fix the problems mentioned above. I am doing this in my free time, so the updates
may be slow, but I love the Dark Crystal and Rimworld, so they will surely happen.

I do not claim to be an expert on Dark Crystal lore, so please correct me if anything stands
out.

Disclaimer: I hope to not have offended anyone as I modeled my code after some other
mods. I also do not own or claim anything about the Dark Crystal, it all belongs to the
Jim Henson Company.
