V1.0
        Dark Crystal - Gelfling
    Basic mod for what will hopefully become a series of mods tributing Jim Henson&amp;apos;s The Dark 
    Crystal. So far it only contains a general race that is the Gelfling, but there are plans
    for much more.
    
    Requires: erdelf Humanoid Alien Races 2.0 mod

    Suggested: EdB Prepare Carefully mod

    Known Problems:
        - Portrait image has misaligned ears
        - Male Gelfling can be assigned with the Maudra/All Maudra backstory
        - Can be more than 1 All Maudra
        - &amp;quot;Skiing on weapons&amp;quot; (see pictures)

    Future Plans:
        - Animals: Landstriders, Nebries, Garthim, Arathim, Fizgig, Hollerbats, Muski
        - Races: Gelfling clans, Skeksis, urRu (Mystics), Gruenak, Aughra, Podling, Lore
        - Items: Healing plants, insect meals, Gelfling essence, Crystal Shard, Firca, Bola
        - Events: restore the Crystal of Thra, Great Conjuncture, feast, Tithing
        - Biomes: Spriton Plains, Dark Wood, Highlands?, Crystal Sea, Black River, Caves of Grot
        - Misc: give girls wings, add Vliyaya (from J.M. Lee&amp;apos;s books), better art, standard scenario

    This is my first mod and I do not know what I am doing most of the time, but it has been fun
    so far. I would love to hear feedback on what is already here and maybe suggestions on 
    how to fix the problems mentioned above. I am doing this in my free time, so the updates 
    may be slow, but I love the Dark Crystal and Rimworld, so they will surely happen.

    I do not claim to be an expert on Dark Crystal lore, so please correct me if anything stands
    out. 

    Disclaimer: I hope to not have offended anyone as I modeled my code after some other
    mods. I also do not own or claim anything about the Dark Crystal, it all belongs to the 
    Jim Henson Company.
